import Typography from '@/components/ui/typography';

### No installation needed
FlickerUI is not a component library, it's a collection of pre-made, animated React components. <br/>
You can add each component to your project by using the FlickerUI CLI:
```bash "[component]"
npx flicker-ui@latest add [component]
```
<span className="[&>p]:text-sm [&>p]:text-foreground-muted mt-1">
All the **npm dependencies**, and other **hooks** and **components** used in the specified component will automatically be installed for you.
</span>

<br/>
Hooks alone can be added by using the --hook flag
```bash "[hook]"
npx flicker-ui@latest --hook add [hook]
```

<br/>
