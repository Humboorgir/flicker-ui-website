title: "useClickOutside"
description: "Executes a function once the user clicks outside of the given element."
---

## Installation

The following command will add the useClickOutside hook into your `hooks` folder

```bash
$ npx flicker-ui@latest --hook add useClickOutside
```

<br />

## Usage

The hook takes in a function (handler) and returns a ref.
Attach the ref to an element. Once the user clicks outside of that element, your function will be called.
```js {2}
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
const ref = useClickOutside(() => setIsOpen(false));

// For instance:
<div ref={ref}>Clicking outside of this element would trigger the handler</div>
```
