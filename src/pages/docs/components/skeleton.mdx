## Installation

The following command will add the Skeleton component into your `components/ui` folder

```bash
$ npx flicker-ui@latest add skeleton
```

<br />

## Usage

The Skeleton component automatically adjusts its height according to its container. You can also manually provide
a width and height via the `className` prop. 

<Note>Make sure to define "--skeleton-base" and "--skeleton-highlight" as HSL color codes (CSS variables) for the component to work. <br/>
For instance: --skeleton-base: 0 0% 92%;</Note>

```js /items="center"/ /justify="center"/
<Badge variant="success" size="md">Badge</Badge>
```
