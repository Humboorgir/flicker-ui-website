Here's an example of how you would do that:

```js /accordionItems/ /items/
 const accordionItems = [
    {
      trigger: "Accordion tab 1",
      content: "Accordion tab 1 content",
    },
    {
      trigger: "Accordion tab 2",
      content: "Accordion tab 2 content",
    },
    {
      trigger: "Accordion tab 3",
      content: "Accordion tab 3 content",
    },
    {
      trigger: "Accordion tab 4",
      content: "Accordion tab 4 content",
    },
  ];

  return <Accordion className="max-w-[600px]" items={accordionItems} />;
```
